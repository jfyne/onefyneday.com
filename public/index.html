            Travel and exploration has always been a big part of our relationship. One of the first places we visited together
            was Iceland, we loved it and <em>vowed</em> (üòâ üòâ) to return. Luckily we have got this wedding coming up and thought it
            would be great to share what we loved so much with everyone else.

                        black t-shirt. Please dress warm, if you would like to wear a dress or suit we will not stop you
                        but
                        please bring layers. The ceremony is going to be outside, some sort of outdoor
                        shoes are advisable. There is a surprise outing after the ceremony that will be outdoors.
